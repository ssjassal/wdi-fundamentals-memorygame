  <a name="Description"></a><h2>Description</h2>
    <article><p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso, or Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid facedown on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p></article>

  <div>
  <a name="Variations"></a><h2>Variations of the Game</h2>
    <article><p>Concentration is not limited to playing cards. Many versions of the game that are designed for children may have different themes. In some computer versions, the cards may randomly move to increase the difficulty.Many of these may be played in combination with one another:
      <ol type="A">
        <li>
          <b>Any Color:</b>A version especially good for young children where matching pairs need only be of the same rank, not the same color. When playing with jokers, these count double because they are more difficult to match.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <b>One Flip:</b> Players who make a successful pair win these cards but do not go again until their next turn.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <b>Zebra:</b>Pairs may only be formed by cards of the same rank, but opposite in color (so 7 of diamonds would match with a 7 of clubs or spades, but not a 7 of hearts)
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <b>Two Decks: </b> For a much longer game, shuffle together two 52-card decks and lay them out in 8 rows of 13 cards (9 rows of 12 cards if using jokers). Pairs must be identical (same rank and same suit, so the 10 of clubs would have to match the other 10 of clubs).
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <b>Two Decks Duel: </b> Duel is a two-player game where the playing field is divided into two separate parts. Each player shuffle a full 52-card deck and lay it out in 4 rows of 13 cards. The players cannot access each other's cards. Player one starts, flipping one card face-up, then player two selects one card from his/her own side. If the pair is a match, cards are removed, if not, they are flipped back. Pairs must be identical (same rank and same suit, so the 10 of clubs would have to match the other 10 of clubs). After every turn roles are exchanged, in this case: player two flips a card and player one answers.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <b>Double Decker Checkerboard: </b>For a slightly easier version of the two-pack game, use decks with different backs and shuffle them separately. Deal them out in a checkerboard pattern (red, blue, red, blue, etc.) The different backs help identify the position in the grid and significantly reduce the possibility of which cards will match.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <b>Fancy: </b>The cards need not be laid out in a strict rectangular grid and many players have their own special layouts that include circular, triangular, or diamond-shaped formations. Dealers may select any layout they wish.
        </li><br>     
        <li>
          <b>Spaghetti: </b>Same rules as standard concentration, only the cards are not laid out in neat rows. They are strewn randomly about on the floor.
        </li><br>
      </ol>
    </p></article></div>

  <a name="Instructions"></a><h2>Instructions</h2>
    <article><p>The rules given here are for a standard deck of 52 cards, which are normally laid face down in four rows of 13 cards each. In turn, each player chooses two cards and turns them face up. </p>
    <p>If they are of the same rank and color (e.g. six of hearts and six of diamonds, queen of clubs and queen of spades) then that player wins the pair and plays again.</p>
    <p> If they are not of the same rank and color, they are turned face down again and play passes to the player on the left. Rules can be changed here too: it can be agreed before the game starts that matching pairs be any two cards of the same rank, a color-match being unnecessary, or that the match must be both rank and card suit.
    </p>
    <p>The game ends when the last pair has been picked up. The winner is the person with the most pairs. There may be a tie for first place.</p></article>
